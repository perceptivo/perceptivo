  abstract = {Feature preserving image interpolation is an active area in image processing field. In this paper a new direct edge directed image super-resolution algorithm based on structure tensors is proposed. Using an isotropic Gaussian filter, the structure tensor at each pixel of the input image is computed and the pixels are classified to three distinct classes; uniform region, corners and edges, according to the eigenvalues of the structure tensor. Due to application of the isotropic Gaussian filter, the classification is robust to noise presented in image. Based on the tangent eigenvector of the structure tensor, the edge direction is determined and used for interpolation along the edges. In comparison to some previous edge directed image interpolation methods, the proposed method achieves higher quality in both subjective and objective aspects. Also the proposed method outperforms previous methods in case of noisy and JPEG compressed images. Furthermore, without the need for optimization in the process, the algorithm can achieve higher speed.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In the standard Hughson-Westlake hearing tests (Carhart and Jerger 1959), patient responses like a button press, raised hand, or verbal response are used to assess detection of brief test signals such as tones of varying pitch and level. Because of its reliance on voluntary responses, Hughson-Westlake audiometry is not suitable for patients who cannot follow instructions reliably, such as pre-lingual infants (Northern and Downs 2002). As an alternative approach, we explored the use of the pupillary dilation response (PDR), a short-latency component of the orienting response evoked by novel stimuli, as an indicator of sound detection. The pupils of 31 adult participants (median age 24 years) were monitored with an infrared video camera               during               a standard hearing test in which they indicated by button press whether or not they heard narrowband noises centered at 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. Tests were conducted in a quiet, carpeted office. Pupil size was summed over the first 1750 ms after stimulus delivery, excluding later dilations linked to expenditure of cognitive effort (Kahneman and Beatty 1966; Kahneman et al. 1969). The PDR yielded thresholds comparable to the standard test at all center frequencies tested, suggesting that the PDR is as sensitive as traditional methods of assessing detection. We also tested the effects of repeating a stimulus on the habituation of the PDR. Results showed that habituation can be minimized by operating at near-threshold stimulus levels. At sound levels well above threshold, the PDR habituated but could be recovered by changing the frequency or sound level, suggesting that the PDR can also be used to test stimulus discrimination. Given these features, the PDR may be useful as an audiometric tool or as a means of assessing auditory discrimination in those who cannot produce a reliable voluntary response.},

To limit the variation of programming outcomes, 10 standard audiograms, which cover the entire range of audiograms met in clinical practice, have been defined. This article describes how the set of standard audiograms has been developed. This set of standard audiogram has been derived by a vector quantization analysis method on a database of 28,244 audiograms. Using this analysis method, sets of typical audiograms have been obtained of sizes 12 and 60. It turned out that the smaller set could not be used for selecting audiograms as sloping audiograms were absent. Therefore, the larger set has been analyzed to provide seven standard audiograms for flat and moderately sloping hearing loss and three standard audiograms for steep hearing loss.},

This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the estimation problem in which the hearing threshold is modelled as a smooth continuous function of frequency using a Gaussian process. This allows sampling at any frequency and reduces the number of required measurements. The Gaussian process is combined with a probabilistic response model to account for uncertainty in the responses. The resulting full model can be interpreted as a two-dimensional binary classifier for stimuli, and provides uncertainty bands on the estimated threshold curve. The optimal next stimulus is determined based on an information theoretic criterion. This leads to a robust adaptive estimation method that can be applied to fully automate the hearing threshold estimation process.},

  abstract = {Pure-tone audiometry\textemdash the process of estimating a person's hearing threshold from ``audible'' and ``inaudible'' responses to tones of varying frequency and intensity\textemdash is the basis for diagnosing and quantifying hearing loss. By taking a probabilistic modeling approach, both optimal tone selection (in terms of expected information gain) and hearing threshold estimation can be derived through Bayesian inference methods. The performance of probabilistic model-based audiometry methods is directly linked to the quality of the underlying model. In recent years, Gaussian process (GP) models have been shown to provide good results in this context. We present methods to improve the efficiency of GP-based audiometry procedures by improving the underlying model. Instead of a single GP, we propose to use a GP mixture model that can be conditioned on side-information about the subject. The underlying idea is that one can typically distinguish between different types of hearing thresholds, enabling a mixture model to better capture the statistical properties of hearing thresholds among a population. Instead of modeling all hearing thresholds by a single GP, a mixture model allows specific types of hearing thresholds to be modeled by independent GP models. Moreover, the mixing coefficients can be conditioned on side-information such as age and gender, capturing the correlations between age, gender, and hearing threshold. We show how a GP mixture model can be optimized for a specific target population by learning the parameters from a data set containing annotated audiograms. We also derive an optimal tone selection method based on greedy information gain maximization, as well as hearing threshold estimation through Bayesian inference. The proposed models are fitted to a data set containing roughly 176 thousand annotated audiograms collected in the Nordic countries. We compare the predictive accuracies of optimized mixture models of varying sizes with that of an optimized single-GP model. The usefulness of the optimized models is tested in audiometry simulations. Simulation results indicate that an optimized GP mixture model can significantly outperform an optimized single-GP model in terms of predictive accuracy, and leads to significant increases the efficiency of the resulting Bayesian audiometry procedure.},

  abstract = {Psychophysical detection tests are ubiquitous in the study of human sensation and the diagnosis and treatment of virtually all sensory impairments. In many of these settings, the goal is to recover, from a series of binary observations from a human subject, the latent function that describes the discriminability of a sensory stimulus over some relevant domain. The auditory detection test, for example, seeks to understand a subject's likelihood of hearing sounds as a function of frequency and amplitude. Conventional methods for performing these tests involve testing stimuli on a pre-determined grid. This approach not only samples at very uninformative locations, but also fails to learn critical features of a subject's latent discriminability function. Here we advance active learning with Gaussian processes to the setting of psychophysical testing. We develop a model that incorporates strong prior knowledge about the class of stimuli, we derive a sensible method for choosing sample points, and we demonstrate how to evaluate this model efficiently. Finally, we develop a novel likelihood that enables testing of multiple stimuli simultaneously. We evaluate our method in both simulated and real auditory detection tests, demonstrating the merit of our approach.},

  abstract = {When measuring thresholds, careful selection of stimulus amplitude can increase efficiency by increasing the precision of psychometric fit parameters (e.g., decreasing the fit parameter error bars). To find efficient adaptive algorithms for psychometric threshold (``sigma'') estimation, we combined analytic approaches, Monte Carlo simulations and human experiments for a one-interval, binary forced-choice, direction-recognition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time analytic results have been combined and compared with either simulation or human results. Human performance was consistent with theory and not significantly different from simulation predictions. Our analytic approach provides a bound on efficiency, which we compared against the efficiency of standard staircase algorithms, a modified staircase algorithm with asymmetric step sizes, and a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure. Simulation results suggest that optimal efficiency at determining threshold is provided by the MLE procedure targeting a fraction correct level of 0.92, an asymmetric 4-down, 1-up (4D1U) staircase targeting between 0.86 and 0.92 or a standard 6D1U staircase. Psychometric test efficiency, computed by comparing simulation and analytic results, was between 41\%\textendash 58\% for 50 trials for these three algorithms, reaching up to 84\% for 200 trials. These approaches were 13\%\textendash 21\% more efficient than the commonly-used 3D1U symmetric staircase. We also applied recent advances to reduce accuracy errors using a bias-reduced fitting approach. Taken together, the results lend confidence that the assumptions underlying each approach are reasonable, and that human threshold forced-choice decision-making is modeled well by detection-theory models and mimics simulations based on detection theory models.},

  abstract = {Time-efficient hearing tests are important in both clinical practice and research studies. This particularly applies to notched-noise tests, which are rarely done in clinical practice because of the time required. Auditory-filter shapes derived from notched-noise data may be useful for diagnosis of the cause of hearing loss and for fitting of hearing aids, especially if measured over a wide range of center frequencies. To reduce the testing time, we applied Bayesian active learning (BAL) to the notched-noise test, picking the most informative stimulus parameters for each trial based on nine Gaussian Processes. A total of 11 hearing-impaired subjects were tested. In 20 to 30\,min, the test provided estimates of signal threshold as a continuous function of frequency from 500 to 4000\,Hz for nine notch widths and for notches placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically around the signal frequency. The thresholds were found to be consistent with those obtained using a 2-up/1-down forced-choice procedure at a single center frequency. In particular, differences in threshold between the methods did not vary with notch width. An independent second run of the BAL test for one notch width showed that it is reliable. The data derived from the BAL test were used to estimate auditory-filter width and asymmetry and detection efficiency for center frequencies from 500 to 4000\,Hz. The results agreed with expectations for cochlear hearing losses that were derived from the audiogram and a hearing model.},

Both methods provided an estimate of threshold as a continuous function of frequency. For one method, six successive tones with decreasing levels were presented on each trial and the task was to count the number of tones heard. A Gaussian Process was used for classification and maximum-information sampling to determine the frequency and levels of the stimuli for the next trial. The other method was based on a published method using a Yes/No task but extended to account for lapses. The obtained audiograms were compared to conventional audiograms for 40 ears, 19 of which were hearing impaired. The threshold estimates for the active-learning methods were systematically from 2 to 4\,dB below (better than) those for the conventional audiograms, which may indicate a less conservative response criterion (a greater willingness to respond for a given amount of sensory information). Both active-learning methods were able to allow for wrong button presses (due to lapses of attention) and provided accurate audiogram estimates in less than 50 trials or 4\,min. For a given level of accuracy, the counting task was slightly quicker than the Yes/No task.},

During data collection using the qAF procedure, listeners detected the presence of a pure-tone signal presented in the spectral notch of a noise masker. Dependent on the listener's response on each trial, the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters were updated, and the resulting parameter estimates were then used to optimize the choice of stimulus parameters for the subsequent trials. Results showed that the qAF procedure gave similar parameter estimates to the traditional threshold-based procedure in many cases and was able to reasonably predict the masked signal thresholds. Additional measurements suggested that occasional failures of the qAF procedure to reliably converge could be a consequence of incorrect responses early in a qAF track. The addition of a parameter describing lapses of attention reduced the likelihood of such failures.},

  abstract = {Extracting geometrical information from large 2D or 3D biomedical images is important to better understand fundamental phenomena such as morphogenesis. We address the problem of automatically analyzing spatial organization of cells or nuclei in 2D or 3D images of tissues. This problem is challenging due to the usually low quality of microscopy images as well as their typically large sizes. The structure tensor is a simple and robust descriptor that was developed to analyze textures orientation. Contrarily to segmentation methods which rely on an object based modeling of images, the structure tensor considers the sample at a macroscopic scale, like a continuous medium. We show that this tool allows quantifying two important features of nuclei in tissues: their privileged orientation as well as the ratio between the length of their main axes. A quantitative evaluation of the method is provided for synthetic and real 2D and 3D images. As an application, we analyze the nuclei orientation and anisotropy on multicellular tumor spheroids cryosections. This analysis reveals that cells are elongated in a privileged direction that is parallel to the spheroid boundary. A MATLAB toolbox and an Icy plugin are available to use the proposed method.},
